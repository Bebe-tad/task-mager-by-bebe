# Task Manager 📝

Hi, I'm Betelhem tadegegn.  
This is a simple Task Manager app I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my internship competition.

---

=> What it does

- Shows a list of tasks
- Lets you add a new task
- Lets you mark a task as completed
- Lets you delete a task

=> How it works
- Tasks are stored in a hardcoded array
- JavaScript updates the DOM when you add, complete, or delete a task
- Completed tasks are styled differently with a line-through

 =>Files

- `index.html` → structure  
- `style.css` → styling  
- `script.js` → logic

=>Notes
- No backend, no frameworks — just clean and simple code
- Built for learning and showing my frontend skills
- Designed to be fast, responsive, and beginner-friendly
